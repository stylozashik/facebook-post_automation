# facebook-post_automation
Automating Facebook posting can be achieved using the Facebook Graph API along with Python.  Also, keep in mind that automating actions on Facebook should comply with Facebook's Platform Policy.

Set up a Facebook App: You need to create a Facebook App on the Facebook Developer platform. This will provide you with the necessary credentials (App ID and App Secret) to access the Graph API.

Authenticate: Obtain an access token with the required permissions to manage the Facebook Page you want to post to.

Use the Graph API: Utilize the Facebook Graph API to create a post on the desired Facebook Page. You'll need to make an HTTP POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the post content and any additional parameters.

Handle Errors and Exceptions: Implement error handling to deal with any issues that may arise during the posting process, such as network errors or invalid access tokens.

Here's a basic example using the requests library to make HTTP requests to the Facebook Graph API:

'''
  import requests

def post_to_facebook(page_id, access_token, message):
    url = f"https://graph.facebook.com/{page_id}/feed"
    data = {
        "message": message,
        "access_token": access_token
    }
    response = requests.post(url, data=data)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Post successful!")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to post: {response.json()}")

# Example usage
page_id = "YOUR_PAGE_ID"
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
message = "Hello, Facebook World!"
post_to_facebook(page_id, access_token, message)

'''

Replace "YOUR_PAGE_ID" and "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" with your actual Facebook Page ID and access token respectively.

Make sure to review the Facebook Graph API documentation for detailed information on endpoints, parameters, and permissions required for posting to a Facebook Page. Also, keep in mind that automating actions on Facebook should comply with Facebook's Platform Policy.

# suppose, I did it all. now I want to pull content from a google drive and it will keep title and description as video files name. Can you help me to implement!
Absolutely! To achieve this, you can use the Google Drive API to access files from Google Drive and then extract the title and description from the metadata of the video files. Here's a basic outline of how you can implement this:

Set up Google Drive API: You need to create a project in the Google Developers Console and enable the Google Drive API. This will provide you with credentials (client ID and client secret) to authenticate your application.

Authenticate with Google Drive API: Use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate your application and obtain an access token.

Retrieve Video Files: Use the Drive API to list and retrieve the video files from your Google Drive.

Extract Title and Description: Extract the title and description from the metadata of each video file.

Here's a Python script to get you started:

'''
import os
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Define scopes and credentials file
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly']
CLIENT_SECRET_FILE = 'credentials.json'

def authenticate():
    flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(CLIENT_SECRET_FILE, SCOPES)
    creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
    return creds

def list_video_files(service):
    results = service.files().list(q="mimeType='video/*'").execute()
    files = results.get('files', [])
    return files

def extract_metadata(file):
    title = file['name']
    description = file.get('description', '')
    return title, description

def main():
    creds = authenticate()
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)
    video_files = list_video_files(service)
    
    for file in video_files:
        title, description = extract_metadata(file)
        print(f"Title: {title}, Description: {description}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
'''

Make sure to replace 'credentials.json' with the path to your credentials file obtained from the Google Developers Console.

This script will authenticate your application with the Google Drive API, list all the video files in your Google Drive, and extract the title and description for each video file. You can then modify it to suit your needs, such as saving this metadata to a file or integrating it with your Facebook posting automation script.

# How do I can run it?
To run the provided Python script, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:
'''
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
'''
Obtain Credentials: You need to obtain credentials from the Google Developers Console and save them in a JSON file named credentials.json. Follow the steps outlined in the Google Drive API documentation to create a project, enable the Drive API, and obtain the credentials.

Modify Script (Optional): If you want to change any parameters such as scopes or the file path for credentials, you can modify the script accordingly.

Run the Script: Once you have installed the required libraries and obtained the credentials, you can run the script using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
'''
python your_script_name.py
'''
Replace your_script_name.py with the name of the Python script file you saved the code in.

Authentication Process: When you run the script for the first time, it will open a browser window asking you to log in to your Google account and grant permissions to access your Google Drive. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the authentication process.

View Output: The script will then list the title and description of each video file in your Google Drive.

Remember to ensure that the credentials.json file is in the same directory as your Python script, or provide the correct path to it in the script.

### Full code that can authenticate using Facebook Graph API and Pull video files from google directory to queue posting. In future I am ambitious to implement post scheduling feature. Is there anyone who can help me to write that feature?
